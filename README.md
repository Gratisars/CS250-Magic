//Collection of CS250 works.

//How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
Requires active listening and observation to capture the user's perspective and utlize "User Stories" to translate into code.//

//How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories help developers understand, visualize and produce a product that meets users requests.//

//How do I approach developing programs?
Utilizing a structured framework such as Scrum-Agile methodology, giving a team collaboration, feedback, team goal driven with everyone being involved.//

//What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Hands down I would implement Scrum meetings, a forum that provides the team a chance to air concerns, gain feedback and estimate future Sprint tasks.//

//What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Basically an individual whom is open to feedback, provides effective communication, takes ownership of project tasks and coding standards.//
